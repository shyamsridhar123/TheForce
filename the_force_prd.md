# The Force Programming Language: PRD & Roadmap

### TL;DR

The Force is a Star Wars-inspired programming language that brings the galaxy far, far away to your code editor. With syntax and structure modeled after iconic Star Wars concepts—such as Jedi for functions and Sith for classes—The Force compiles into Python, making it accessible for both fans and developers. Designed as a community-driven, open-source project, it aims to make programming fun, educational, and engaging for Star Wars enthusiasts and Pythonistas alike.

## Goals

### Business Goals

* Grow an active open-source community with at least 100 contributors within the first year.

* Achieve 1,000+ GitHub stars and 500+ forks within 12 months.

* Establish The Force as a go-to example of themed, educational programming languages.

* Launch a user showcase to highlight creative projects and drive community engagement.

* Expand language compilation support beyond Python to at least one additional language (e.g., C++ or Go) within 18 months.

### User Goals

* Enable Star Wars fans to learn programming in a fun, immersive way.

* Allow Python developers to experiment with and contribute to a novel language project.

* Provide clear, accessible documentation and onboarding for new users.

## Narrative

In a galaxy not so far away, programming can feel intimidating and dull—especially for those just starting out. Enter The Force, a programming language that transforms code into an adventure, inviting Star Wars fans and developers alike to wield the power of the Jedi and the cunning of the Sith.

Imagine a young fan, inspired by the saga, writing their first Jedi function or crafting a Sith class to model their favorite droid. The familiar language and playful syntax make learning to code feel like joining the Rebellion. Meanwhile, seasoned Python developers discover a new playground for language design, contributing features and helping others master the ways of The Force.

As the community grows, users showcase their creations—games, tools, and stories—fueling a vibrant ecosystem. The Force becomes more than a language; it’s a gathering place for fans, learners, and makers, united by a love of Star Wars and a passion for code. Together, they prove that with the right inspiration, anyone can become a master.

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Needs

* Core compiler (force_complier.py) to parse Force syntax and generate Python code.

* CLI tool for compiling and running Force programs.

* Themed documentation site (static or generated).

* Optional: plugin system for extensibility.

### Integration Points

* Integration with Python runtime for executing compiled code.

* Optional: editor plugins for syntax highlighting (VSCode, Sublime, etc.).
