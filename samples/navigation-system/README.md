# Navigation System - Mathematical Operations

Welcome to the Galactic Navigation System! This sample demonstrates mathematical operations and calculations in The Force Programming Language through a comprehensive space navigation and targeting system.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this sample, you will learn:
- Mathematical calculations using `force_calculate`
- Random number generation using `midichlorians`
- Distance calculations using `lightsaber_distance`
- Coordinate geometry and positioning
- Statistical operations and data analysis
- Practical mathematical problem solving
- Space navigation algorithms

## What This Program Does

This program simulates a galactic navigation system that:
1. Calculates distances between star systems
2. Generates random navigation coordinates
3. Performs trajectory calculations for space travel
4. Computes fuel requirements and travel times
5. Analyzes targeting data for military operations
6. Demonstrates various mathematical operations
7. Provides navigation assistance for starships

## Mathematical Features

### Basic Calculations (force_calculate)
```force
holocron result = force_calculate("add", 150, 75)
```
Perform arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt.

### Random Numbers (midichlorians)
```force
holocron random_coordinate = midichlorians(0, 1000)
```
Generate random numbers for coordinates, fuel variations, and uncertainty factors.

### Distance Calculations (lightsaber_distance)
```force
holocron distance = lightsaber_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```
Calculate distances between points in 2D space using the Pythagorean theorem.

### Advanced Math Operations
- Trigonometric functions for trajectory calculations
- Statistical analysis of navigation data
- Coordinate transformations and rotations

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the navigation-system directory
2. Run the program using the Force compiler:
   ```bash
   python ../../force_compiler.py main.force
   ```
