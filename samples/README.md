**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Features:** Integration of OOP, data structures, text processing, and mathematical operations

## How to Run the Samples

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- The Force Programming Language compiler (force_compiler.py)

### Running Individual Samples
1. Navigate to any sample directory
2. Run the main Force file:
   ```bash
   python ../../force_compiler.py main.force
   ```

### Running All Samples
```bash
# From the samples directory
python ../force_compiler.py hello-galaxy/main.force
python ../force_compiler.py jedi-academy/main.force
python ../force_compiler.py galactic-database/main.force
python ../force_compiler.py rebel-communications/main.force
python ../force_compiler.py navigation-system/main.force
python ../force_compiler.py mission-control/main.force
```

## Learning Path

**For Beginners:**
1. Start with `hello-galaxy` to understand basic syntax
2. Move to `navigation-system` for mathematical operations
3. Try `galactic-database` to learn data structures

**For Intermediate Users:**
1. Explore `jedi-academy` for object-oriented programming
2. Challenge yourself with `rebel-communications` for text processing

**For Advanced Users:**
1. Dive into `mission-control` for complex application development
2. Experiment with combining features across different samples

## Sample Structure

Each sample directory contains:
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation and learning objectives
- `main.force` - Primary executable code
- Additional `.force` files as needed for complex examples
