# Rebel Communications - Text Processing & Encryption

Welcome to the Rebel Communications Center! This sample demonstrates advanced text processing and encryption capabilities in The Force Programming Language through a secure communication system.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this sample, you will learn:
- String manipulation using `protocol_droid`
- Regular expressions using `regex_pattern`
- Encryption operations using `force_encrypt`
- Hash functions using `force_hash`
- Text formatting using `hologram_text`
- Advanced string processing techniques
- Security and cryptography basics

## What This Program Does

This program simulates a rebel communications system that:
1. Processes incoming transmissions with text analysis
2. Encrypts sensitive messages using various algorithms
3. Validates message integrity with hash functions
4. Searches for patterns using regular expressions
5. Formats messages for secure transmission
6. Demonstrates practical text processing workflows

## Text Processing Features

### String Manipulation (protocol_droid)
```force
holocron processed = protocol_droid("uppercase", message)
```
Transform text with operations like uppercase, lowercase, reverse, and length.

### Regular Expressions (regex_pattern)
```force
holocron found = regex_pattern("search", "pattern", text)
```
Search for patterns, extract data, and validate text formats.

### Encryption (force_encrypt)
```force
holocron encrypted = force_encrypt("base64_encode", secret_message)
```
Encode sensitive information for secure transmission.

### Hash Functions (force_hash)
```force
holocron signature = force_hash("sha256", message)
```
Create digital signatures and verify message integrity.

### String Formatting (hologram_text)
```force
respond hologram_text("Message from {}: {}", sender, content)
```
Format messages with placeholder substitution.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the rebel-communications directory
2. Run the program using the Force compiler:
   ```bash
   python ../../force_compiler.py main.force
   ```

## Expected Output

```

## Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by:
1. Creating your own secret messages to encrypt
2. Adding new text transformation functions
3. Implementing custom encryption algorithms
4. Creating message validation systems
5. Building automated communication protocols

## Security Note

This sample demonstrates basic encryption concepts for educational purposes. In production systems, use established cryptographic libraries and follow security best practices.

## Next Steps
